<p align="center"> :globe_with_meridians:  path_finder is a program for calculating the shortest route from point a to point b,  the Floyd-Warshall algorithm was used for the calculation. This is an algorithm for finding the lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted directed graph</p>
